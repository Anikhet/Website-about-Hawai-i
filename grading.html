         <h1>Pros and Cons of My Hawaii Travel Website</h1>
         <section class="pros">
            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Comprehensive Content: My website covers a wide range of topics related to Hawaii travel, from history and culture to accommodations and activities. This makes it a one-stop-shop for travelers looking for information about Hawaii.</li>
               <li>Visual Appeal: My decision for including images, especially for the food and dining section, adds visual appeal to the website and can help engage visitors.</li>
               <li>User-Friendly Navigation: Having separate pages for different categories in my website (e.g., Destinations, Things to Do, Travel Guide) makes it easy for users to find the information they need.</li>
               <li>Detailed Activity Information: Providing details about various activities, such as snorkeling, surfing, and whale watching, can help travelers plan their trip and decide what they want to do in Hawaii.</li>
               <li>Flip images was used in Activites</li>
               <li> Maps were used in the Food section</li>
            </ul>
         </section>
         <section class="cons">
            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Limited Destinations: Currently, the website only mentions Maui and Oahu. Including more destinations within Hawaii could provide a more comprehensive guide for travelers.</li>
               <li>Lack of Interactive Features: Adding interactive features, such as maps or a search function, could enhance the user experience and make it easier for visitors to find specific information.</li>
               <li>No Personalization: Offering personalized recommendations or itineraries based on user preferences or interests could make the website more engaging and useful for individual travelers.</li>
            </ul>
